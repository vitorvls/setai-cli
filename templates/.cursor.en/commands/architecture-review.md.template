# Architecture Review

## Objective
Validate architectural decisions before writing code. Evaluate existing architecture and suggest improvements.

## Input
- Project context
- Existing code (if applicable)
- Current architecture
- Decisions made

## Instructions
You are acting as the architect responsible for system quality.

Based on project context and existing code:

1. **Evaluate current architecture**
   - Strengths
   - Weaknesses
   - Alignment with objectives

2. **Point out excessive coupling**
   - Problematic dependencies
   - Coupling between modules
   - Boundary violations

3. **Suggest improvements aiming for:**
   - Scalability
   - Testability
   - Clarity
   - Maintainability

4. **Explain trade-offs of each decision**
   - What was gained
   - What was sacrificed
   - Alternatives considered

## Constraints
- Don't implement anything yet
- Focus on analysis and suggestions
- Be constructive and technical
- Consider project context and constraints

## Output
Structured analysis with:
- Architecture evaluation
- Identified problems
- Improvement suggestions
- Explained trade-offs
