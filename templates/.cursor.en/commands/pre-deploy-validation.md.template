## Objective
Final check before production. Final validation before deployment.

## Project Context

**Project:** {{PROJECT_NAME}}  
**Type:** {{PROJECT_TYPE}}  
**Stack:** {{LANGUAGE}} + {{FRAMEWORK}}{{#if DATABASE}} + {{DATABASE}}{{/if}}

{{#if FRAMEWORK_EXPRESS}}
**Deployment Platform:** {{DEPLOYMENT_PLATFORM}}
{{/if}}

## Input
- Code to be deployed
- Changes since last deploy
- Project context
- Deployment checklist

## Instructions
Before deployment, perform final validation considering:

1. **Business rules**
   - Were all rules followed?
   - Is business logic correct?
   - Are validations implemented?

2. **Security**
   - Are inputs validated?
   - Are secrets not exposed?
   - Does authentication/authorization work?

3. **Observability**
   - Are logs configured?
   - Are errors captured?
   - Are metrics available?
   - Is monitoring active?

4. **Maintainability**
   - Is code documented?
   - Are tests present?
   - Were patterns followed?
   - Is code clean?

## Constraints
- Don't alter code
- Focus on validation and checklist
- Be specific about problems
- Prioritize critical over warnings

## Output
Structured validation with:
- Complete checklist
- Attention points
- Critical problems (if any)
- Final suggestions
