# Challenge Solution

## Objective
Avoid single model bias. Challenge and validate proposed solutions.

## Project Context

**Project:** {{PROJECT_NAME}}  
**Type:** {{PROJECT_TYPE}}  
**Stack:** {{LANGUAGE}} + {{FRAMEWORK}}{{#if DATABASE}} + {{DATABASE}}{{/if}}

**Constraints:** {{TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS}}

## Input
- Previously proposed solution
- Problem context
- Decisions made
- Alternatives considered

## Instructions
Analyze the previously proposed solution.

Challenge the decisions made:

1. **What can go wrong?**
   - Technical risks
   - Business risks
   - Failure points
   - Cases not considered

2. **Are there simpler alternatives?**
   - More direct solutions
   - Fewer abstractions
   - Less complexity
   - Fewer dependencies

3. **Where is there risk of overengineering?**
   - Unnecessary abstractions
   - Premature complexity
   - Premature optimizations
   - Unnecessary features

## Constraints
- Be critical and direct
- Focus on real problems, not theoretical perfection
- Consider context and constraints
- Suggest alternatives when appropriate

## Output
Critical analysis with:
- Identified risks
- Simpler alternatives
- Overengineering points
- Recommendations
