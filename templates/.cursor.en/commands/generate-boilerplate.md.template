# Generate Boilerplate

## Objective
Delegate mechanical work to AI. Generate boilerplate code following project patterns.

## Input
- Type of boilerplate needed (component, API, service, etc.)
- Defined architecture
- Project patterns

## Instructions
Based on defined architecture and project patterns:

Generate necessary boilerplate for this module following:

1. **Strictly follow existing patterns**
   - File structure
   - Naming conventions
   - Code patterns

2. **Don't introduce new abstractions**
   - Use only established patterns
   - Don't create new layers without need
   - Maintain consistency

3. **Comment only where necessary for clarity**
   - Avoid obvious comments
   - Comment important decisions
   - Document complexity

## Constraints
- Follow rules in `.cursor/rules/code-style.md`
- Use allowed libraries (`.cursor/libs/allowed-libs.md`)
- Don't use forbidden libraries (`.cursor/libs/forbidden-libs.md`)
- Maintain consistent structure

## Output
Ready-to-use boilerplate code with:
- Correct structure
- Patterns followed
- Appropriate comments
- Quick explanation of created structure
