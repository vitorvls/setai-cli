- Existing tests (if any)

## Instructions
Refactor selected code with the following objectives:

1. **Improve readability**
   - Clearer names
   - Clearer structure
   - Reduce cognitive complexity

2. **Reduce complexity**

   - Extract functions when appropriate
   - Remove duplicate code

3. **Maintain 100% of current behavior**
   - Don't alter functionality
   - Don't alter public interface
   - Maintain compatibility

## Constraints
- Don't alter behavior
