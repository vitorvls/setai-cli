# .cursor Configuration

## Objective
This folder contains all configuration and context for efficient AI usage in project development.

## Structure

### 📂 `context/`
Persistent project context - answers "How does this project think?"

- `architecture.md` - Architectural decisions and patterns
- `tech-stack.md` - Complete technology stack
- `project-goals.md` - Business objectives and context
- `deployment.md` - Infrastructure and deployment process

### 📂 `rules/`
Hard rules - contract with AI

- `code-style.md` - Mandatory code standards
- `testing-rules.md` - Testing strategy and rules
- `git-rules.md` - Commit and PR standards
- `security-rules.md` - Mandatory security rules
- `ai-usage-rules.md` - Where and how to use AI
- `business-rules.md` - Business rules

### 📂 `libs/`
Source of truth about dependencies

- `allowed-libs.md` - Allowed libraries
- `forbidden-libs.md` - Forbidden libraries
- `ai-models.md` - Allowed AI models and when to use them

### 📂 `commands/`
Executable prompts - reusable commands

- `kickoff-project.md` - Align business understanding
- `architecture-review.md` - Validate architectural decisions
- `extract-business-rules.md` - Extract business rules
- `test-strategy.md` - Structure testing strategy
- `generate-boilerplate.md` - Generate boilerplate code
- `refactor-controlled.md` - Controlled refactoring
- `generate-docs.md` - Generate technical documentation
- `review-pr.md` - PR review
- `challenge-solution.md` - Challenge solutions
- `pre-deploy-validation.md` - Pre-deployment validation

## How to Use

### For Developers
1. **Configure lint and formatter BEFORE starting** (see `rules/code-style.md`)
2. Read files in `context/` to understand the project
3. Follow rules in `rules/`
4. Use only libs in `libs/allowed-libs.md`
5. Use prompts in `commands/` when appropriate

### For AI
AI should:
1. **Check if lint is configured before generating code**
2. Read `rules/` first (hard rules)
3. Consult `context/` to understand the project
4. Check `libs/` before suggesting dependencies
5. Use `commands/` as prompt templates
6. **Always generate code that passes the configured lint**

## Principles

- **Explicit context > Beautiful prompt**
- **Hard rules, not suggestions**
- **Living documentation, not static**
- **AI proposes, humans approve**

## Maintenance

- Update files when there are changes
- Maintain consistency between files
- Document important decisions
- Review periodically
